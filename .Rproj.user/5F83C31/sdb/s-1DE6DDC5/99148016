[Ongoing\n  - Lattice graphics]'\nauthor: \"Maurizio Murino\"\ndate: \"3 March 2016\"\noutput: html_document\n---\n```{r setoption, cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12)\n```\n\n```{r, loadlattice}\nlibrary(lattice)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(xtable)\n```\n\n### Exercise 1 - 3/3/'16\n\nYou lose information from the data when yu create a histogram. What information is lost?\n\n__Solution:__\n\nYou do not know the actual value of the data anymore, but only the group where they fall into.\n\n### Exercise 2 - 3/3/'16\n\nMake a histogram from this dataset of test scores: 72, 79, 81, 80, 63, 62, 89, 90, 50, 78, 87, 97, 55, 69, 97, 87, 88, 99, 76, 78, 5, 77, 88, 90, 81. Would a pie chart be appropriated for this data?\n\n```{r 2.1 dataload}\ne2 <- c(72, 79, 81, 80, 63, 62, 89, 90, 50, 78, 87, 97, 55, 69, 97, 87, 88, 99, 76, 78, 65, 77, 88, 90, 81)\n```\n```{r 2.2 histogram, lattice}\nhistogram(~e2,\n          type = \"count\",\n          xlab = \"Test scores\",\n          main = \"Test scores\",\n          breaks = seq(from = 50, to = 100, by = 5))\nmax(e2)\n```\n\nA pie chart is not appropriate. Pie charts are more useful with categorical data.\n\n### Exercise 3 - 4/3/'16\n\nSurvey of 45 home-owners. Of them, 2 do not have a TV, 17 have 1, 22 have 2, 3 have 3, 1 has 4. Make a relative frequency histogram of this data and interpret the result.\n\n```{r 3.1 dataload}\ne3 <- data.frame(tv = rep(c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4), c(2, 17, 22, 3, 1)))\nsum(e3$tv)\n```\n\n```{r 3.2 histogram}\nhistogram(~e3,\n          xlab = \"TVs\",\n          main = \"Distribution of 73 Tvs between 45 owners\",\n          breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 4, by = 1))\n```\n\n### Exercise 4 - 6/3/'16\n\nThink a loaded die. Make it roll several times. \n\n```{r 4.1 dataload}\ne4 <- data.frame(n = rep(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), c(10, 15, 5, 15, 5, 20)))\nhistogram(~n, data = e4,\n          type = \"count\",\n          main = \"260 die rolls\",\n          xlab = \"Die result\",\n          breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 6, by = 1))\n```\n\n__A. Make the relative frequency histogram of these results.__\n\n```{r 4.2 plot1}\nhistogram(~n, data = e4,\n          main = \"Relative requencies - 260 die rolls\",\n          xlab = \"Die result\",\n          breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 6, by = 1))\n```\n\n__B. You can make a relative frequency histogram from a frequency histogram; can you go to the other direction?__\n\nWell, it is possible, but only by arbitrarily determining a sample size, that is unknow. Hence, it is no really useful.\n\n### Exercise 5 - 6/3/'16\n\nAn ATM machine asks to choose an amount in 50$ increments from 100 from $500. Results from a recent sample of customer withdrawals are shown in the figures. Discuss shape, center and spread of the data. \n\n```{r 5.1 dataload}\ne5 <- data.frame(withdraw = rep(c(100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500), c(14, 23, 23, 4, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2)))\nbarchart(e5,\n          main = \"Withdrawals\",\n          type = \"count\",\n          horizontal = FALSE,\n          xlab = \"Withdrawals\",\n          breaks = seq(from = 100, to = 500, by = 50))\n```\n\n### Exercise 6 - 8/3/'16\n\nHistogram of rods produced by a company. a Rod should be 100 inches long. Discuss the company accuracy by interpreting the shape, center and spread of the data. \n\n```{r 6.1 dataload and plot}\ne6 <- data.frame(lngth = rep(seq(from = 99.2, to = 100.6, by = 0.1), c(1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 2, 8, 7, 10, 10, 6, 7, 2, 1, 4)))\n\nhistogram(~lngth, data = e6,\n          breaks = seq(from = 99.2, to = 100.6, by = 0.1),\n          type = \"count\",\n          main = \"Rods length\",\n          xlab = \"Rods\")\n```\n\n```{r 6.2 data summary xtable, results=\"asis\"}\nkable(summary(e6), format = \"markdown\", align = \"c\", row.names = TRUE)\n```\n\nThe distribution is slightly skewed to the left, even if it this quite close to the center. Even so, the 50% of the production is between 99.85 and 100.2, being really accurate.  \n",
