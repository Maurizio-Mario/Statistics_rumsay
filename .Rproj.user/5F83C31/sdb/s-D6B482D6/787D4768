See the following frequency table.\n\n```{r}\ne1 <- data.frame(category = integer(375)) \ne1$category <- rep(c(\"SUV\",\"Truck\",\"Car\"), c(150,125,100))\n\n# Frequency tables\nxtabs(e1) \n```\n\n__A. Make a relative frequency table of these results__\n\n```{r}\nround(prop.table(table(e1$category)), digits = 2)\n```\n\n__B. Make a pie chart of these results__\n\n```{r chart}\npie(table(e1), labels = paste(c(\"SUV \",\"Truck \",\"Car \"), round(prop.table(table(e1$category))*100, digits = 1), \"%\", sep = \"\") , main = \"Vehicles - n: 375\", col = rainbow(3))\nlegend(\"topleft\", c(\"SUV\",\"Truck\",\"Car\"), cex = 0.6, fill = rainbow(3))\n```\n\nC. Interpret the results\n\nThe sample of cars (375 vehicles) is composed by trucks, cars and SUVs in the proportions of 40, 33.3 and 26.7 percent respectively.\n\n### Excercise 2 - 5/2/'16\n\nFor a month, a restaurant owner checks off whem a customer patronize his restaurant. He records the data for 1000 customers for one month. \n\n```{r2 chart}\ncustomers <- data.frame(category = integer(1000))\ncustomers$category <- rep(c(\"Breakfast\", \"Lunch\", \"Dinner\", \"Other\"), c(10*6.7, 10*22.2, 10*44.4, 10*26.7))\nxtabs(customers)\npie(table(customers), labels = paste(c(\"Breakfast\", \"Lunch\", \"Dinner\", \"Other\"), round(prop.table(table(customers$category))*100, digits = 2), \"%\" ), main = \"Restaurant customers - n: 1000\", col = rainbow(4))\nlegend(\"topright\", c(\"Breakfast\", \"Lunch\", \"Dinner\", \"Other\"), cex = 0.5, fill = rainbow(4))\n```\n\n__A. What does this information tell the restaurant owner?__\n\nIts restaurant is particularly appreciated in the midday. The 44.4% of the 1000 sampled customers patronize the restaurant for lunch. That is the breakfast restaurant of choice only for the 6.7% of the customers. Better result for dinner, with 22.2%. A relevant 26.7% of customers is uncategorized.\n\n__B. What is the problem with the \"other\" category? How can this study improved in the future?__\n\nThe category \"other\" covers more customers than \"dinner\" and \"breakfast\". Such an amount of information should be properly investigated. It could group categories of customers that normally do not fit the usual schedules, but that could be enough relevant represent a potential economic gain, if treated adequately. \n\n\n\n\n\n",
