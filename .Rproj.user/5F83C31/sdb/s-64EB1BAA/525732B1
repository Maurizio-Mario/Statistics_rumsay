Because of the empirical rule, I can say that I am approximately part of 65% of the scores of this exam, since the 68% of scores usually are between one standard deviation from the mean.

Suppose corn grows best when the annual rain fall is between 100 and 150 inches. What is the chance of achieving this amount of rainfall?\n\n```{r 22.1}\nzPlot(100, 100, 25, 3, 150)\n```\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe chance of achieving an amount of rainfall between 100 and 150 is 47.7%.\n\n### Exercise 23 - 15/4/'16 - EasieR on duty!\n\nWeights have a normal distribution with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 10. What weight has 60 percent of the values lying below it?\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe z-score for the 60th (0.6) percentile is 0.25. The cutting point $x$ is $z\\sigma + \\mu$, that is `r .25*10+100`.\n\n```{r 23.1}\nzPlot(102.5, 100, 10, 1)\n```\n\n### Exercise 24 - 15/4/'16 - EasieR on duty!\n\nJimmy walks a mile, and his previous times have a normal distribution with a mean of 8 minutes and a standard deviation of 1 minute. What time does he have to make to get into his own top 10 precent of his fastest times?\n\n\n\n**Solution:**\n\nSince we are talking about times, the lower the better. Jimmy's z-score has to be in the  for the 10th (0.1) percentile: -1.28. The cutting point $x$ is $z\\sigma + \\mu$, that is 6.72 minutes.\n\n```{r 24.1}\nzPlot(6.72, 8, 1, 1)\n```\n\n\n### Exercise 25 - 16/4/'16 - EasieR on duty!\n\nThe times it takes to complete a statistics exam have a normal distribution with a mean of 40 minutes and standard deviation of 6 minutes. Deshawn's time falls at the 42nd percentile. How long does Deshawn take to finish the exam?\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe z-score for the 42nd percentile (0.42) is -0.2. Hence, because of the $z$ for $x$ formula $x = z\\sigma + \\mu$, the time $x$ for Deshawn in finishing the exam is 38.8 minutes. Let's test the result with the `zPlot` function. \n\n```{r 25.1}\nzPlot(38.8, 40, 6)\n```\n\n\n### Exercise 26 - 16/4/'16 - EasieR on duty!\n\nExam scores for a particular test have a normal distribution with a mean of 75 and standard deviation of 5. The instructor wants to give the top 20% of the scores an A. What is the cutoff for an A?\n\n**Solution:**\n\nSince we are looking for the top 20% of the distribution, we are looking for the 80th percentile. The z-score for the 8Oth percentile (0.8) is 0.84. Hence, the $x$ representing the cut point is, according to the formula $x = z\\sigma + \\mu$, 79.2.\n\n```{r 26.1}\nzPlot(79.2, 75, 5)\n```\n\n\n### Exercise 27 - 16/4/'16 - EasieR on duty!\n\nService call times for one company have a normal distribution with a mean of 10 minutes and a standard deviation of 3 minutes. Researchers study the longest 10% of the call to make improvements. How long do the longest 10 percent last?\n\n**Solution:**\n\nIn this case, we are referring to higher part of the distribution, that is, the 90th percentile (0.9). The z-score for the 90th percentile is 1.28 and the $x$, according to the formula $x = z\\sigma + \\mu$, is 13.84 minutes.\n\n```{r 27.1}\nzPlot(13.84, 10, 3)\n```\n\n\n### Exercise 28 - 16/4/'16 - EasieR on duty!\n\nStatcars have a miles per gallon normal distribution with a mean of 75. Twenty-percent of the vehicles get more than 100 miles per gallon. What is the standard deviation?\n\n**Solution:**\n\nSince we are interested in the top 20% of the distribution, we shall consider the 80th percentile. The z-score for the 80th percentile (0.8) is 0.84. The standard deviation $\\sigma$, hence, is $(x - \\mu)/z = 29.76$ \n",
