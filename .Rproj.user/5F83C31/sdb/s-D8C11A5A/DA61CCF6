I make a n = 100 dataframe.\n\ne3 <- data.frame(color = rep(c(\"brown\", \"yellow\", \"red\", \"blue\", \"orange\", \"green\"), c(13, 14, 13, 24, 20, 16)))\nbarchart(~table(color), data = e3,\n         xlab = \"Percentage\",\n         main = \"Balls (no N)\")\n```\n\n__A. What is the chance that you extract a brown or yellow ball?__\n\nIt is the sum of the quantities of yellow and brown balls on the total, that is:\n\n```{r 3.2 prob}\npaste((13 + 14), \"%\", sep = \"\")\n```\n\n__B. What is the chance that you will not pull out a blue?__\n\nBlue balls represent the 24% of the pool. Hence, the probability of not extracting it is:\n\n```{r 3.3 prob}\npaste((100 - 24), \"%\", sep = \"\")\n```\n\n\nThis is an R Markdown document.

You can embed an R code chunk like this:\n\n```{r}\nsummary(cars)\n```\n\nYou can also embed plots, for example:\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\nplot(cars)\n```\n\nNote that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.\n",
