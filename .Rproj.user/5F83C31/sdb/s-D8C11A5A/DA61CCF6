I make a n = 100 dataframe.\n\ne3 <- data.frame(color = rep(c(\"brown\", \"yellow\", \"red\", \"blue\", \"orange\", \"green\"), c(13, 14, 13, 24, 20, 16)))\nbarchart(~table(color), data = e3,\n         xlab = \"Percentage\",\n         main = \"Balls (no N)\")\n```\n\n__A. What is the chance that you extract a brown or yellow ball?__\n\nIt is the sum of the quantities of yellow and brown balls on the total, that is:\n\n```{r 1.2 prob}\npaste((13 + 14), \"%\", sep = \"\")\n```\n\n__B. What is the chance that you will not pull out a blue?__\n\nBlue balls represent the 24% of the pool. Hence, the probability of not extracting it is:\n\n```{r 1.3 prob}\npaste((100 - 24), \"%\", sep = \"\")\n```\n\n### Exercise 2 - 6/3/'16\n\nFlip a coin four times and have four head. Does this outcome give you the idea that the coin is not fair?\n\n__Solution:__\n\nWe do not have enough data to answer this question. Four coin tosses produce `2^4 = 16` possible results. Four heads represents a single possible result, hence the probability of getting it is `1/16 = .06`. It is not likely, but it is possible. ",
