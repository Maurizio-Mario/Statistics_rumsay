Because of the empirical rule, I can say that I am approximately part of 65% of the scores of this exam, since the 68% of scores usually are between one standard deviation from the mean. Futhermore, a z-score of 0.9 corresponds to the 81.59th percentile.\n\n### Exercise 14 - 15/4/'16 - Easier on duty!\n\nIf a beby's weight is ad the median, what is her percentile?\n\n**Solution:** It is the 50th percentile.\n\n### Exercise 15 - 15/4/'16 - EasieR on duty!\n\nClint sleeps an average of 8 hours per night with a standard deviation of 15 minutes. What is the chance he will sleep less than 7.5 hours tonight?\n\n```{r 15.1}\nzPlot(7.5, 8, 0.25, 1)\n\n```\n\n**Solution:** \n\nThe probability for Clint to sleep less than 7.5 hours is 2.3%.\n\n### Exercise 16 - 15/4/'16 - EasieR on duty!\n\nSuppose you know that Bob's test score is above the mea, but he does not remember how much. At least, how many students must score lower than Bob?\n\n**Solution:**\n\nAt least the 50%.\n\n### Exercise 17 - 15/4/'16 - EasieR on duty!\n\nBob's commuting times to work have a normal distribution with a mean of 45 minutes and a standard deviation of 10 minutes. How often does Bob get to work in 30 to 45 minutes?\n\n```{r 17.1}\nzPlot(30, 45, 10, 3, 45)\n```\n\n**Solution:**\n\nBob gets to work in 30 to 45 minutes the ~43% of the times.\n\n### Exercise 18 - 15/4/'16 - EasieR on duty!\n\nThe times taken to complete a statistics exam has a normal distribution with a mean of 40 minutes and a standard deviation of 6 minutes. What is the chance of Deshawn completing the exam in 30 to 35 minutes?\n\n```{r 18.1}\nzPlot(30, 40, 6, p = 3, y = 35)\n```\n\n**Solution:** \n\nThe probability for Deshawn of completing the exam in 30 to 35 minutes is 15.4%.\n\n### Exercise 19 - 15/4/'16 - EasieR on duty!\n\nTimes untile service at a restaurant have a normal distribution with mean of 10 minutes and standard deviation of 3 minutes. What is the chance of it taking longer than 15 minutes to get served?\n\n```{r 19.1}\nzPlot(15, 10, 5, p = 2)\n```\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe probability to get served in more than 15 minutes is the 15.9%.\n\n### Exercise 20 - 15/4/'16 - EasieR on duty!\n\nAt the same restaurant as in problem 19 with the same normal distribution, what is the chance of it taking no more than 15 minutes to get service?\n\n```{r 20.1}\nzPlot(15, 10, 5, 1)\n```\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe probability to get served in more than 15 minutes is the 84.1%.\n\n### Exercise 21 - 15/4/'16 - EasieR on duty!\n\nClint, obviously not in college, sleeps an average of 8 hours per night with a standard deviation of 15 minutes. What is the chance of him sleeping between 7.5 and 8.5 hours on any given night?\n\n```{r 21.1}\nzPlot(7.5, 8, 0.25, 3, 8.5)\n```\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe probability of Clint sleeping between 7.5 and 8.5 hours per night is 95.4%.\n\n### Exercise 22 - 15/4/'16 - EasieR on duty!\n\nOne state's annua rainfall has a normal distribution with a mean of 100 inches and a standard deviation of 25 inches. Suppose corn grows best when the annual rain fall is between 100 and 150 inches. What is the chance of achieving this amount of rainfall?\n\n```{r 22.1}\nzPlot(100, 100, 25, 3, 150)\n```\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe chance of achieving an amount of rainfall between 100 and 150 is 47.7%.\n\n### Exercise 23 - 15/4/'16 - EasieR on duty!\n\nWeights have a normal distribution with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 10. What weight has 60 percent of the values lying below it?\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe z-score for the 60th (0.6) percentile is 0.25. The cutting point $x$ is $z\\sigma + \\mu$, that is `r .25*10+100`.\n\n```{r 23.1}\nzPlot(102.5, 100, 10, 1)\n```\n\n### Exercise 24 - 15/4/'16 - EasieR on duty!\n\nJimmy walks a mile, and his previous times have a normal distribution with a mean of 8 minutes and a standard deviation of 1 minute. What time does he have to make to get into his own top 10 precent of his fastest times?\n\n\n\n**Solution:**\n\nSince we are talking about times, the lower the better. Jimmy's z-score has to be in the  for the 10th (0.1) percentile: -1.28. The cutting point $x$ is $z\\sigma + \\mu$, that is 6.72 minutes.\n\n```{r 23.1}\nzPlot(6.72, 8, 1, 1)\n```",
