### Exercise 1 - 4/3/'16

Balls colors: "brown" 13%, "yellow" 14%, "red" 13%, "blue" 24%, "orange" 20%, "green" 16%.

```{r 3.1 dataload}
# There is no sample dimension. I make a n = 100 dataframe.

e3 <- data.frame(color = rep(c("brown", "yellow", "red", "blue", "orange", "green"), c(13, 14, 13, 24, 20, 16)))
barchart(~table(color), data = e3,
         xlab = "Percentage",
         main = "Balls (no N)")
```

__A. What is the chance that you extract a brown or yellow ball?__

It is the sum of the quantities of yellow and brown balls on the total, that is:

```{r 3.2 prob}
paste((13 + 14), "%", sep = "")
```

__B. What is the chance that you will not pull out a blue?__

Blue balls represent the 24% of the pool. Hence, the probability of not extracting it is:

```{r 3.3 prob}
paste((100 - 24), "%", sep = "")
```


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
