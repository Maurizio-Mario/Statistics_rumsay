### Exercise 1 - 22/6/'16

Suppose you take a sample of 100 from a skewed population with mean 50 an standard deviation 15.

**a.** What sample size condition do you need to check here?
**b.** What's the shape and center of the sampling distribution for $\=X$?
**c.** What's the standard error?


**Solution:** 

**a.** The sample should be at least 30. The condition is met.
**b.** Because of the Central Limit Theorem that states that every sample has approximately a normal distribution, we can say that the sample distribution is bell shaped. The center is 50, since the mean of a sample distribution tends to be like the population mean.
**c.** The standard error of the sample distribution is $\sigma/\sqrt{n}$, that is 1.5.

### Exercise 2 - 23/6/'16

Suppose you take a sample of 100 from a population that contains 45 percents Democrats.

**a.** What sample size condition do you need to check here (if any)?
**b.** What's the standard error of $\^p$?
**c.** Compare the standard errors of $\^p$ for n = 100, n = 1000, n = 10000 and comment.

**Solution:**

**a.** We should check if $n*p$ is larger than 10. In our case, $100 * 0.45 = 45$, hence we can say that the Central Limit Theorem can be applied.
**b.** The standard error for sample proportions is $\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$, that is, $\sqrt{\frac{.45(1 - .45)}{100}} = 0.05244$.
**c.** The standard error diminutes as the sample size increases. For n = 1000 the standard error is 0.01658, and for n = 10000 is 0.01658. It represents superior precision due to the bigger sample.

### Exercise 4 - 8/7/'16

Suppose a coin is fair (so $p = 1/2$ for heads or tails). 

**a.** Guess how many times you have to flip the coin to get the standard error down to only 1 percent (don't do any calculations).
**b.** Now use the standard error formula to figure it out.

**Solution:**

**a & b:**
```{r 4.1}

# Sample size 1.

set.seed(123)
x <- sample(c(1, 0), 10, replace = TRUE)
mean(x)
std_er <- sd(x)/sqrt(length(x)) 
paste0(round((std_er*100)), "%")

# Increase the sample size to 100.

set.seed(123)
x <- sample(c(1, 0), 100, replace = TRUE)
mean(x)
std_er <- sd(x)/sqrt(length(x)) 
paste0(round((std_er*100)), "%")

# Increase the sample size to 1000.

set.seed(123)
x <- sample(c(1, 0), 1000, replace = TRUE)
mean(x)
std_er <- sd(x)/sqrt(length(x)) 
paste0(round((std_er*100)), "%")

# Increase size up sto standard error = 1%.

set.seed(123)
z <- sample(c(1, 0), 10, replace = TRUE)

my_f <- function(x){
        y <- sample(c(1, 0), length(x), replace = TRUE)
        se <- sd(y)/sqrt(length(y))
        
        while(se > 0.01){
                y <- c(y, sample(c(1, 0), 1))
                se <- sd(y)/sqrt(length(y))
                
                if(se <= 0.01) break
        }
        print(length(y))
}

t <- my_f(z)
```

As we can see, the standard error decreases as long as the sample size increases.
In the previous simulation, the adequate sample size is 2501.

### Exercise 5 - 8/7/'16

Suppose you have a normal population of quiz scores with mean 40 and standard deviation 10.

**a.** Select a random sample of 40. What's the chance that the mean of the quiz scores won't exceed 45?

**b.** Select one individual from the population. What's the chance that his/her quiz score won't exceed 45?

**Solution:**

**a.** First let's transform the mean in z-value.

```{r 5.1}
z <- (45 - 40)/(10/(sqrt(40)))
z
```
Then, we can check on the z-table and verify that the $$P(\bar{X} < 45) = P(z < (45-40)/(10/\sqrt{40})) = 0.9992$$.

**b.** As for solution "a" we calculate the z-value.

```{r 5.2}
z <- (45 - 40)/10
z
```
In this case, the probability is for the person to get a better score than 45 is 0.6915 for a z-score of 0.5.
